<p>Every Thursday, a group of folks working on <a href="https://github.com/FNNDSC">the ChRIS project</a> meet to share their status for working on the project. There are often useful discussions about development and planning and demos during these meetings. This is a simple site set up to log the meeting minutes of those meetings for posterity. It is driven via the <a href="https://github.com/FNNDSC/status">https://github.com/FNNDSC/status</a> repository.</p>
