        In this tutorial, you'll get ChRIS up and running on your laptop or workstation. Use these instructions to
        play around with it, or to get started setting up a development environment so you can start working on it.
    </div>
</div>

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>
Have
<b><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a></b>
version 2.6 or later installed and working on a <b>Linux</b> system.
WSL 2 on Windows and Docker Desktop for Mac also work, however for optimal performance,
we strongly encourage you to run Linux natively.
</p>

<p>
At least 8GB RAM and 20GB disk space is recommended.
Docker Desktop users should make sure that the Linux VM has 8GB memory or more allocated to it.    
</p>

<h4>Installing Docker on Linux</h4>

<ol>
<li>
    Install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker Engine</a>
    by following the "server" installation guide for your Linux distro.
</li>
<li>
    Add your user account to the <code>docker</code> group as instructed by the
    <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/">post-installation steps</a>.
</li>
</ol>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
Do <b>not</b> install "Docker Desktop for Linux!"
