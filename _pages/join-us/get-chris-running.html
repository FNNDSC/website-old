        In this tutorial, you'll get ChRIS up and running on your laptop or workstation. Use these instructions to
        play around with it, or to get started setting up a development environment so you can start working on it.

<h3>Pre-requisites</h3>

<p>
Have
<b><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">docker-compose</a></b>
version 2.6 or later installed and working on a Linux system.
WSL 2 on Windows and Docker Desktop for Mac also work, however for optimal performance,
we strongly encourage you to run Linux natively.
</p>

<p>
Linux users, be sure to have added yourself to the <code>docker</code> group before proceeding.
Refer to the
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/">
Docker post-installation instructions
</a>
for more details.
</p>

<p>
At least 8GB RAM and 20GB disk space is recommended.
Docker Desktop users should make sure that the Linux VM has 8GB memory allocated to it.
